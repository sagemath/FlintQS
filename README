Standalone CLI implementation of William Hart's Quadratic Sieve.

William Hart was the maintainer of FLINT (https://www.flintlib.org/)
for many years; a modern and actively-maintained version of this
quadratic sieve is available in FLINT itself, as qsieve_factor().
There remain unfixed build issues and at least one security
vulnerability (CVE-2023-29465) in FlintQS. As a result, FlintQS is
considered obsolete.
